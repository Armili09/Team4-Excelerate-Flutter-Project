# Team4-Excelerate-Flutter-Project
## Project Vision
The Mobile Learning App is designed to provide a modern, mobile-first learning experience that is intuitive, engaging, and goal-driven. The vision is to create a single platform where learners can discover programs, enroll in courses, track their progress, and earn meaningful achievements—all with minimal friction and maximum clarity.

## Project Objectives
The key objectives of this project are to:
- Deliver a clean, user-friendly mobile learning experience
- Simplify course discovery, enrollment, and application workflows
- Enable learners to easily resume learning and track progress over time
- Increase engagement through visual progress indicators, streaks, and achievements
- Support certifications and skill validation through digital credentials
- Provide a scalable foundation for future enhancements such as analytics and personalization

## App Navigation Flow
The application uses a tab-based navigation structure optimized for mobile usability. Each tab has a clearly defined purpose within the learning journey.
